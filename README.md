The function data_proc(wmean=TRUE, startle=TRUE, fulldays=TRUE) take the data from the DAM system and processes it in various ways. 
It reads all the text files in the current directory and processes them according to the keyword arguments. 
For example setting wmean to false eg. (data_proc(wmean=FALSE)) will prevent the data from having the william's mean applied to it.
